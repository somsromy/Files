### Ideas for hacks : 

The idea that our data and personal information are being used by companies and other systems is a big deal to me and triggers me into wanting to take control over what’s being shared of my personal information. How can we hack the data that we produce? For example, what does our bank account activity tell us about who we are, and how can we overcome this forged idea?
Similarly, how do we “disappear”? Could we come up with a way of completely being anonymous and transparent in society? What would it take for us to fool the systems around us into believing that we no longer exist? 
Joan Fontcuberta’s fake animal archive exhibition (Link to the description : http://juanmagonzalez.com/fontcuberta/fauna.html). Joan Fontcuberta is an artist that made this exhibition together with a photographer, by faking photographs/montages/taxidermy…. into creating a fake archive of a scientist researcher that had found these surreal creatures.
People who went to the exhibition had to believe these archives were true, because of the context they were presented in.
Now, with photoshop/internet it is much easier to fake something and present it as legitimate. Fake news spread fast and enough “social experiments” have proven that people will believe what you write in a published article online. Which makes some people also more skeptical about that. Maybe these people will want to rely on other sources such as newspapers, TV or museums to inform themselves of what happens in the world.
How can we hack a fairly trusted source into spreading fake information similarly to Joan Fontcuberta in a playful way and a topic that wouldn’t have “dangerous” consequences (a topic that went dangerously far based on fake news are vaccines causing the anti-vax movement for example).
Similarly to Joan Fontcuberta we could create a fictional object/discovery, document it as a strange finding in a specific context and present it as such to a larger audience that would be inclined to trust its authenticity.
